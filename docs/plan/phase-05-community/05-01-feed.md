# 05.1 Community feed — system design + steps

## Goal

Public feed that shows both user posts and resolved complaint posts.

## Schema mapping

- Read: `community_posts`

## Backend API

### `GET /api/community/feed`

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "USER_POST",
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string",
    "mediaUrls": ["string"],
    "createdAt": "timestamptz"
  }
]
```

Ordering

- Newest first (`created_at desc`).

## Frontend

Route: `/community`

- Render list
- Visual distinction based on `type` (text label is enough)

## Acceptance criteria

- Feed loads from real backend endpoint
