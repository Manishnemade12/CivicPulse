# Phase 06 — Frontend (Next.js)

## Outcome

Frontend screens built in parallel with backend APIs.

## Rule

Do not build big UI batches without backend verification. Each UI piece must hit a real endpoint.

## Sub-tasks

1. 06.1 App routes + layout skeleton
2. 06.2 Auth screens (based on chosen auth)
3. 06.3 Complaints: new/list/detail
4. 06.4 Community: feed/post/detail
5. 06.5 Admin panel
