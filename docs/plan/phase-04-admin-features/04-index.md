# Phase 04 — Admin / Authority Features

## Outcome

- Admin can view complaints
- Admin can update complaint status and add resolution notes
- When status becomes `RESOLVED`, backend auto-creates a community post

## Sub-tasks (small chunks)

1. 04.1 Admin list complaints
2. 04.2 Admin update status + action log
3. 04.3 Auto-create community post on resolve
4. 04.4 Admin UI panel to drive these APIs
